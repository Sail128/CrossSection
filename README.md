# CrossSection
This program calculates the centroid, neutral axis and shearcenter for a closed wingbox.
It does this with the folowing assumptions:
*the wingbox can be approximated using the boom aproximation
*the wingbox is thin walled
*the wing box is symmetric across the x-axis, but not necesarily in the ammount of stringers
*front and back spar are of equal tichkness
*upper and lower skin are of equal thickness
